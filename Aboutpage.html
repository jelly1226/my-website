    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>As I continue to grow I hope to become very successful in designing. I want to have a huge company, not for money but to show people what I can really do. First I want to graduate highschool with a scholarship so that I won't owe debt. I want to have an athlethic scholarship becasue I happen to very good at running.
       I did Cross-Country for about a year until I decided to stop because I was moving and going to a school that was closer to my house.
      I want to study being a buisness manager and a doctor. I want to become a doctor first so that I can work for a long time and then save up and build a company. I want to do it this way to make sure
      I don't go bankrupt. I don't want to start a major buisness and owe lots of money. I would like to go to Ohio State University to study.It seems like a great college I plan to spend at least 6 years or more because I want to learn as much as possible so I can be fluent in what i'm doing.
