        <h2>About Me</h2>

           I graudually became comfortable as I started to make more friends whom we all get along together.

        <h3>Origin Story</h3>
        <p>My room was just begging to be cleaned and as <strong>I was cleaning my room</strong> I began to get ideas on how to organize my room. At first, I began with my clothes and my closet then I started to design with washi tape. <em>Washi tape</em> is a pretty, decorative paper masking tape. It has different colors and different decorating patterns. The tape is easy to stick on any surfaces including wood, plastic, and metal and it is easy to remove without causing any damage. It makes things easier so I wonâ€™t have fear of ruining the wall. I used the Washi Tape to spell out my name and it turned out better than I had expected. On that day I decided to start doing more decorating things.
        So I redecorated my sisters room , I spelled her name out just like I did with mine and i did other things like moving things around and I hung some more things and it looked it great.</p>
