        <h3>Origin Story</h3>
        <p>My room was just begging to be cleaned and as I was cleaning my room I began to get ideas on how to organize my room. At first, I began with my clothes and my closet then I started to design with washi tape. Washi tape is a pretty, decorative paper masking tape. It has different colors and different decorating patterns. The tape is easy to stick on any surfaces including wood, plastic, and metal and it is easy to remove without causing any damage. It makes things easier so I wonâ€™t have fear of ruining the wall. </p>

        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
        <p>As I continue to grow I hope to become very successful in designing. I want to have a huge company, not for money but to show people what I can really do.</p>
